# Quick Start

This short guide will walk you through the basic process of using IoTDB. For a more detailed introduction, please visit our website's [User Guide](https://www.timecho.com/docs/zh/UserGuide/latest/QuickStart/QuickStart_timecho.html).

## Prerequisites

To use IoTDB, you need to have:


1. Java >= 1.8 (Recommended Java version is 17, 1.8, 11 to 17 are verified. Please make sure the environment path has been set accordingly).
2. Set the max open files num as 65535 to avoid the "too many open files" error.
3. (Optional) Set the somaxconn as 65535 to avoid "connection reset" error when the system is under high load.
    ```
    # Linux
    > sudo sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=65535
   
    # FreeBSD or Darwin
    > sudo sysctl -w kern.ipc.somaxconn=65535
    ```

## Installation

IoTDB provides two installation methods, you can refer to the following suggestions, choose the one fits you best:


* Please contact timechodb staff to obtain the IoTDB installation package. This method provides pre-compiled binary executables, ready to use out of the box, suitable for quick deployment and direct use.

* Please contact timechodb staff to obtain the Docker image. This method supports containerized deployment and is suitable for scenarios requiring flexible environment configuration or rapid migration.

For more specific installation methods, please visit our website's [User Guide](https://www.timecho.com/docs/zh/UserGuide/latest/QuickStart/QuickStart_timecho.html).

## Start

You can go through the following steps to test the installation. If there is no error returned after execution, the installation is completed.

### Start IoTDB

Users can start 1C1D IoTDB by the start-standalone script under the sbin folder.

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-standalone.sh

# Windows
> sbin\start-standalone.bat
```

### Use IoTDB

#### Use Cli

IoTDB offers different ways to interact with server, here we introduce the basic steps of using Cli tool to insert and query data.

After installing IoTDB, there is a default user 'root', its default password is 'TimechoDB@2021'. Users can use this
default user to login Cli to use IoTDB. The start-up script of Cli is the start-cli script in the folder sbin. When executing the script, user should assign
IP, PORT, USER_NAME and PASSWORD. The default parameters are "-h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw TimechoDB@2021".

Here is the command for starting the Cli:

```
# Unix/OS X
> sbin/start-cli.sh -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root

# Windows
> sbin\start-cli.bat -h 127.0.0.1 -p 6667 -u root -pw root
```

The command line cli is interactive, so you should see the welcome logo and statements if everything is ready:

```
 _____       _________  ______   ______
|_   _|     |  _   _  ||_   _ `.|_   _ \
  | |   .--.|_/ | | \_|  | | `. \ | |_) |
  | | / .'`\ \  | |      | |  | | |  __'.
 _| |_| \__. | _| |_    _| |_.' /_| |__) |
|_____|'.__.' |_____|  |______.'|_______/  version x.x.x


IoTDB> login successfully
IoTDB>
```

#### Basic commands for IoTDB

Now, let us introduce the way of creating timeseries, inserting data and querying data.

The data in IoTDB is organized as timeseries. Each timeseries includes multiple data–time pairs, and is owned by a database. Before defining a timeseries, we should define a database using CREATE DATABASE first, and here is an example:

```
IoTDB> CREATE DATABASE root.ln
```

We can also use SHOW DATABASES to check the database being created:

```
IoTDB> SHOW DATABASES
+-------------+
|     Database|
+-------------+
|      root.ln|
+-------------+
Total line number = 1
```

After the database is set, we can use CREATE TIMESERIES to create a new timeseries. When creating a timeseries, we should define its data type and the encoding scheme. Here we create two timeseries:

```
IoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status WITH DATATYPE=BOOLEAN, ENCODING=PLAIN
IoTDB> CREATE TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature WITH DATATYPE=FLOAT, ENCODING=RLE
```

In order to query the specific timeseries, we can use SHOW TIMESERIES <Path>. <Path> represent the location of the timeseries. The default value is "null", which queries all the timeseries in the system (the same as using "SHOW TIMESERIES root"). Here are some examples:

1. Querying all timeseries in the system:

```
IoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES
+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
|                   Timeseries|Alias|Database|DataType|Encoding|Compression|Tags|Attributes|
+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature| null|      root.ln|   FLOAT|     RLE|     SNAPPY|null|      null|
|     root.ln.wf01.wt01.status| null|      root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|     SNAPPY|null|      null|
+-----------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
Total line number = 2
```

2. Querying a specific timeseries (root.ln.wf01.wt01.status):

```
IoTDB> SHOW TIMESERIES root.ln.wf01.wt01.status
+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
|              timeseries|alias|database|dataType|encoding|compression|tags|attributes|
+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status| null|      root.ln| BOOLEAN|   PLAIN|     SNAPPY|null|      null|
+------------------------+-----+-------------+--------+--------+-----------+----+----------+
Total line number = 1
```

Inserting timeseries data is a basic operation of IoTDB, you can use the ‘INSERT’ command to finish this. Before insertion, you should assign the timestamp and the suffix path name:

```
IoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status) values(100,true);
IoTDB> INSERT INTO root.ln.wf01.wt01(timestamp,status,temperature) values(200,false,20.71)
```

The data that you have just inserted will be displayed as follows:

```
IoTDB> SELECT status FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01
+------------------------+------------------------+
|                    Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|
+------------------------+------------------------+
|1970-01-01T00:00:00.100Z|                    true|
|1970-01-01T00:00:00.200Z|                   false|
+------------------------+------------------------+
Total line number = 2
```

You can also query several timeseries data using one SQL statement:

```
IoTDB> SELECT * FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01
+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
|                    Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|
+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
|1970-01-01T00:00:00.100Z|                         null|                    true|
|1970-01-01T00:00:00.200Z|                        20.71|                   false|
+------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
Total line number = 2
```

To change the time zone in Cli, you can use the following SQL:

```
IoTDB> SET time_zone=+08:00
Time zone has set to +08:00
IoTDB> SHOW time_zone
Current time zone: Asia/Shanghai
```

Add then the query result will show using the new time zone.

```
IoTDB> SELECT * FROM root.ln.wf01.wt01
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
|                         Time|root.ln.wf01.wt01.temperature|root.ln.wf01.wt01.status|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.100+08:00|                         null|                    true|
|1970-01-01T08:00:00.200+08:00|                        20.71|                   false|
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+------------------------+
Total line number = 2
```

The commands to exit the Cli are:

```
IoTDB> quit
or
IoTDB> exit
```
